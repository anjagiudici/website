Based on the large-scale data collection I contributed to as part of the Schoolpol Project (https://schoolpol.web.ox.ac.uk/home), I am investigating the determinants of post-WW II education reform in Western democracies. This stream of work includes both historical and comparative approaches. In addition to trace the development of specific education reforms and processes, I am involved in constructing a novel database of educational manifestoes issued since 1945 as well as a systematic coding of the degree of organisation and mobilisation of educational stakeholders in post-WW II democracies.

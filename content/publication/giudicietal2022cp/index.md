abstract: "The massification of secondary schooling constitutes the key educational project of the first
post-war period. However, the resulting educational structures differed in terms of streaming
and standardisation. Despite their historical opposition, center-right parties contributed to
shaping these reforms. They opposed standardisation because their distributive strategy rested
on support from elites and middle classes. However, their stance on streaming varied. Centreright
parties supported streaming when they were linked to teachers and private providers who
opposed comprehensive reforms, but supported de-streaming where such groups aligned with
the left. The analysis suggests that common partisan distributive aims can materialize as varied
public service reforms, due their intersection with the productive environment. This paper
shows these outcomes by tracing reforms shaped by center-right parties in Bavaria, France,
and Italy."

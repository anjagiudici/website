I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Education at Newcastle University. I previously worked as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Oxford on the [ERC funded Schoolpol project](https://schoolpol.web.ox.ac.uk/home).

My research revolves around the politics and history of education. I am particularly interested in exploring how ideological, societal, and cultural diversities interact in shaping how education is conceived, governed, and practiced. 

Education constitutes a key means to shape a society's future. Understanding how education systems change and vary, and whose professional and political views and interests they (do not) reflect, is crucial both to understand their impact, and to devise strategies for change. My current work focuses on the politics of education reform in post-WW II Western democracies and on the educational ideas and strategies of the European far right.
